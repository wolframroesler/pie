# Pie Pebble Watchface

This is is a minimalistic watchface for the Pebble smartwatch that shows the hour as a pie segment.

The background is a pie segment that goes from from 12:00 to where the hour hand of a regular watch would be. This pie segment is blue for AM (00:00-11:59) and red for PM (12:00-23:59). The minute is indicated by a white minute hand that extends from the center to the edge of the watch.

In the picture above, the watch is displaying 14:46 (2:46 PM).
